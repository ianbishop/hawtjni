HawtJNI is a code generator that produces the JNI code needed
to implement java native methods. It is based on the
[jnigen](http://www.eclipse.org/swt/jnigen.php) code generator that is
part of the SWT Tools project which is used to generate all the JNI
code which powers the eclipse platform.

Features
--------

* JNI code generated declaratively from annotations on your java code
* Maven integration:
  * Generates JNI source code
  * Generates an autoconf and msbuild source project to build the 
    native library. This gets attached to the maven project as as 
    the native source zip file.
  * Builds the native source tar for the current platform
  * Built native library is stored in a platform specific jar.  This 
  gets attached to the maven project as a platform specific jar file.

Introduction
------------

There are many open source JNI code generators available, but if your
performance sensitive, the code generator used by the eclipse SWT
project is by far the best option. The biggest problem is that it was
not developed to be reused by other projects. It was tightly coupled
to producing the SWT JNI libraries and it could only be run within the
eclipse platform.

HawtJNI has taken that code generator and made it easier to use and
accessible to more projects.
