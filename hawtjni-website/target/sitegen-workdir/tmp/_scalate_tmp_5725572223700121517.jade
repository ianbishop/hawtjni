    The *${project_name}* documentation and site is created using Scalate
    and is stored in git in the same [source control system as the
    code](source.html)

    **Note:** For code highlighting you will need to
    [install](http://pygments.org/download/)
    [http://pygments.org/](http://pygments.org).

  :markdown
  
    If you [grab the source code](source.html) you will find the site
    source in the *${project_id}-website* directory.  The website is
    also built using Maven so, you would

        cd ${project_id}-website
        mvn install

    If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to
    immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use

        mvn jetty:run

    You can now surf the site and see changes immediately.

    If you are on OS X then we highly recommend
    [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) as a great editor which supports
    Textile and Markdown

  h1 Deploying the site
.right
  :markdown
  
    The site is automatically deployed by the CI builds, so you can
    simply wait for the changes to be automatically pushed to the project
    site.
    
    You can manually deploy the site using Maven:
    
        mvn deploy

    Since deployment to our webserver requires proper authorization,
    you will need to add an entry to your ~/.m2/settings.xml file simlilar
    to:
    
    {pygmentize:: xml}
    <server>
      <id>${project_id}-website</id>
      <username>xxxx</username>
      <password>xxxxx</password>
    </server>
    {pygmentize}
