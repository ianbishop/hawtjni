<p>The <a href="http://hawtjni.fusesource.org">HawtJNI</a> project is pleased to announce
the availability of HawtJNI 1.9. HawtJNI is a code generator that produces
the JNI code needed to implement java native methods. It is based on the
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/swt/jnigen.php">jnigen</a> code generator that is part
of the SWT Tools project which is used to generate all the JNI code which
powers the eclipse platform.</p>

<p>Release Highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>Fix issue #7. We now do a write barrier before setting the 'cached' field to 1 so that reader don't see this get re-ordered before all the fields are readable.</li>
<li>Improve the auto generated build systems for windows/OS X</li>
</ul>
